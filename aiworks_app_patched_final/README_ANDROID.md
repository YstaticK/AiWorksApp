Photo→AI‑Video Android Project

This project is a skeleton Android Studio project that packages a local Web UI and a tiny embedded HTTP server (NanoHTTPD).
It also includes ffmpeg-kit as dependency for native ffmpeg usage on Android and okhttp for network requests (e.g., Replicate).

What I provide here:
- A ready Android Studio project skeleton (app module) with Kotlin MainActivity that starts a NanoHTTPD server.
- Web UI files are placed in app/src/main/assets/www/

Important next steps (you must do locally):
1. Open this folder in Android Studio (File > Open) so Gradle and the Android SDK generate wrappers and set up the project.
2. Install Android SDK (API 34) and NDK as required by ffmpeg-kit (follow ffmpeg-kit docs).
3. Configure API keys (Replicate) securely.
4. Implement processing in LocalServer.serve(...) to accept multipart uploads, persist files to app cache, invoke FFmpegKit.execute for processing, and call Replicate via OkHttp to enhance frames.
5. Build a signed APK: Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK.

Why I couldn't produce the APK here:
- Building a production APK requires Android SDK, NDK, and signing keys on a system with Android build tools installed. I can generate the full project and build scripts; you'll build the APK locally or in CI.

I can:
- Add a more complete implementation of the server-side processing (multipart parsing, ffmpeg commands, Replicate calls) inside MainActivity.kt so the project is closer to a working app.
- Provide step-by-step build instructions and recommended ffmpeg-kit version and settings.
- Help set up a GitHub Actions workflow to produce signed APKs automatically if you provide a signing key.
